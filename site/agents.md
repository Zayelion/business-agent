# Site directory guidance

- This folder hosts the static public site served from `https://angelsofcode.com`; keep assets framework-free and CDN-friendly.
- Add or update static pages with semantic HTML and co-locate any supporting CSS or media files inside this directory.
- When modifying layouts, validate responsiveness manually in desktop and mobile widths before shipping.
- No automated tests run here today; document notable visual or behavioral changes in the PR summary.
